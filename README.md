# BASIC
This project is based on the book "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorston Ball. His book is based upon the Monkey Programming language; but, I wanted to follow the ideas while making it my own. Therefore, I have chosen to write an interpreter for BASIC instead. (and maybe a compiler if this project works out)

## Usage
Do not use this interpreter... at least for now. This is meant as an academic exercise and will most likely be missing certain functionality; or may have a deveiation from standard basic operations for the sake of easee in writing the interpreter.
