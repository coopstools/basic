# BASIC
This project is based on the book "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorston Ball. His book is based upon the Monkey Programming language; but, I wanted to follow the ideas while making it my own. Therefore, I have chosen to write an interpreter for BASIC instead. (and maybe a compiler if this project works out)
